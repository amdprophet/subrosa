Subrosa is an IRC daemon written in Clojure.

It's event driven, backed by the Netty server framework.

It's also nowhere near complete and totally unsuitable for anything
other than hacking on.

Handlers for received commands (NICK, JOIN, etc.) are implemented via
java.util.Observable/Observers. This enables many functions (without
knowledge of eachother) to run on each received command -- think
plugins.
